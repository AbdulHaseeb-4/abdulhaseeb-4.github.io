            <strong>Description:</strong> As the Assistant Manager of Customer
            Relations and Operations at ARV Laguna Pvt. Ltd., I played a key
            role in supporting senior managers in customer relationships and
            business development. I managed the operations and customer
            relations department, ensuring efficient workflow and compliance
            with company policies. My responsibilities included hiring,
            training, and evaluating staff, supervising a team, and coordinating
            with various departments to ensure smooth functioning and customer
            satisfaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, I handled customer inquiries, resolved issues, and
            maintained accurate records of unit bookings, transfer
            documentation, and installment recovery. I planned and oversaw
            property ownership transfers, ensuring compliance with legal and
            regulatory requirements. My expertise in ZOHO applications, team
            management, and customer service contributed to the overall success
            of the department.
          </p>
          <p>
            During an official trip to Gujranwala, I utilized my skills in
            office setup, employee training, and project leadership to establish
            a new office and implement a new project. My leadership and
            commitment to excellence were commended by senior management.
